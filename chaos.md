# Chaotic Super Tic-Tac-Toe Mechanics

## Overwriting Markers

- Players can overwrite opponent's markers in any cell, but only after a cooldown period (e.g., 2 turns).
- Overwriting could cost a resource (e.g., points, tokens, or limited overwrite actions per game).
- Overwriting triggers a visual effect and possibly a sound.

## Chaos Elements

- **Random Events:** At random intervals, a cell or board could be locked, swapped, or cleared.
- **Power-Ups:** Players can earn or use power-ups to:
  - Place two markers in one turn
  - Block a cell for a number of turns
  - Swap two cells
  - Reveal the next random event
- **Board Shifts:** Occasionally, the entire board could rotate or shift, moving all markers.
- **Wild Cards:** Some cells could act as wild cards, counting as either X or O for win conditions.

## Game Flow Changes

- Turns could be non-linear (e.g., random player order, or simultaneous moves).
- Win conditions could be altered (e.g., first to win 2 boards, or most boards after a timer).

## Implementation Notes

- Each chaos mechanic should be toggleable in game settings.
- Cooldowns and chaos events should be tracked in the game state.
- UI should clearly indicate when a cell is overwritable, locked, or affected by chaos.

## Thoughts

- These mechanics would make the game unpredictable and fun for casual play.
- Strategic depth increases as players must manage resources and anticipate chaos.
- Could be a separate game mode: "Chaos Mode" in the main menu.
